# Distributed Systems Project

## Introduction

This project aims to recommend the most suitable propagation algorithm for various internet protocols. By analyzing the propagation speed and completion rate, it helps determine the best algorithm for a given protocol.

## Features

- Input protocol graphs using NetworkX
- Calculate propagation speed and completion rate for different algorithms: flooding, gossip, random walk, k-random walk
- Recommend the fastest propagation algorithm meeting a user-defined minimum completion rate
- Utilizes NetworkX for graph processing
